# OpenCV Library Explanation

Welcome to this repository, where I provide a comprehensive explanation and hands-on examples of the **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)**.

## What is OpenCV?

OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and accelerates the use of machine perception in commercial products.

- Developed by Intel
- Supports image & video processing, face detection, object recognition, and much more
- Works with Python, C++, Java, etc.

## Topics Covered

- Reading and displaying images/videos
- Image transformations (resize, rotate, crop)
- Drawing shapes and text
- Color space conversion (BGR â†” HSV, etc.)
- Face & eye detection using Haar cascades
- Object tracking
- Contours and edge detection
